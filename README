Test and interpret individual keyboard characters. Useful to see exactly what code your hardware and software combination returns for a given keystroke. Where our interpretation table isn't complete, the actual decimal values for the key pressed are returned.

Notes:

* The interpretation table is currently unfinished. There are literally between 400 and 700 possible keystroke combinations on the average keyboard. Please look at the complete Ctrl/Shift/Alt combination interpretations of the Ins, Del, Home, End, PgUp, PgDn keys for an example of a full test.

* This has only been tested with &encoding=latin1.

* If you take the time to develop the script further, please forward your explorations or improvements them back to us! (Besides, that's what the GPL is all about. ;)


This is one of many custom utilities and functions for gVim from the Cream project (http://cream.sourceforge.net), a configuration of Vim for those of us familiar with Apple and Windows software.
